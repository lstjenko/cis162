    <h1>Holly Jenko</h1>
    <p>I am a re-entry student interested in Computer
        Science. Hoping to find which areas I enjoy the 
        most has been an interesting process. Current 
        classes are HTML & CSS and Database Design & SQL. 
        Practice and applying the skills are what I am 
        most looking forward too. Looking forward to the 
        semester ahead!</p>
    
    <h1>When I have free time</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I like to walk, train, & care for my dog</li>
        <li>Learn new things</li>
        <li>Cook anything</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One of my favorite positive reinforcement dog training 
       sites is <a href="https://dogsthat.com/">Susan Garrett's DogsThat!</a></p>
